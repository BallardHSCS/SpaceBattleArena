Survivor [Basic Game]
=============

<a name="overview"></a>Overview
-----------

**Survivor** is a basic game which is a great motivator for learning about radar.

The objective is to be the player who has survived the longest in the game world.

Points are awarded for every second the player has lived in the world.

A player's best record is used to determine their ranking, so even if your intermediate score is reset upon being destroyed, if you have lived the longest still overall, you'll win.
