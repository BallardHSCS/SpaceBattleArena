        <h1 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration</h1>

<h2 id="overview"><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Space Battle Arena is highly configurable.  SBA uses a standard type of configuration file format to set options for how the server should run and behave.  </p>

<p>SBA comes with a set of configuration files for different purposes.  However, you&#39;ll probably want to create your own configuration file to represent the settings of your machine and its display (see the <a href="#application">[Application]</a> section below).</p>

<p>As mentioned in the server <a href="setup.html">setup</a> page, the server can optionally take any number of additional config files.  This can be handy to use one config to keep your standard options and a second one to use for any game or activity of the day.</p>

<p>In fact the configuration examples provided with the server do just that and setup a &#39;machine&#39; file to specify the size of the window and then a &#39;lesson&#39; file to use for the activity of the day in class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">SBA_Serv machine_test.cfg lesson_findthemiddle.cfg
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="format"><a name="format"></a>Format</h2>

<p>The configuration file is composed of a number of sections with each section containing one or more options.  It follows the format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[Section Name]
option1name = value
option2name = value

[Section 2 Name]
optionname = value

etc...
</code></pre></div>
<p>The rest of this chapter will be comprised of headers for each of the <em>section</em> names and then sub-headers for each <em>option</em> (and its type) and then a paragraph listing its purpose and possible values.</p>

<p>Possible value types include integer, boolean, string, and percent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integers will be zero or positive only.</li>
<li>Booleans will either be <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</li>
<li>String values will be provided without quotation marks and possible values will be specified in the specific option listing.</li>
<li>Percent values are decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0.  These may be part of a set which is expected to total 1.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also see advanced constructs such as Tuples in parenthesis () or Lists in [], but if you are familiar with <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> formatting, then it shouldn&#39;t be hard to follow.</p>

<p><em>See the default.cfg file for the list of default configuration values.</em></p>

<h2 id="[application]"><a name="application"></a>[Application]</h2>

<p>This section contains options pertaining to the graphical window created to run the SBA server.  It will affect how SBA is presented to you.</p>

<h3 id="fullscreen-=-boolean">fullscreen = boolean</h3>

<p>Specifies whether or not SBA should run fullscreen or in a window.  <strong>Note</strong>: you should make sure that the horizontal and vertical resolutions match your displays resolution values OR you can set <em>both</em> <strong>horz_res</strong> and <strong>vert_res</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for your display resolution to be <em>automatically</em> detected.</p>

<h3 id="horz_res-=-integer">horz_res = integer</h3>

<p>Specifies the horizontal resolution of the SBA window (in pixels).  This should match your monitor resolution if you plan to run the game in fullscreen.</p>

<h3 id="vert_res-=-integer">vert_res = integer</h3>

<p>Specifies the vertical resolution of the SBA window (in pixels).  This should match your monitor resolution if you plan to run the game in fullscreen.</p>

<h3 id="sound-=-boolean">sound = boolean</h3>

<p>Determines if sounds should be played or not.</p>

<h3 id="showstats-=-boolean">showstats = boolean</h3>

<p>If this option is enabled, the server will start with some basic GUI options already enabled showing statistics about a player’s ship.</p>

<h3 id="ship_images-=-integer">ship_images = integer</h3>

<p>This specifies the number of images that can be used for ships in the <em>GUI\Graphics\Ships</em> directory.  Use an existing ship image as a template to create more ship images.  Each frame of a ship should be contained in a 64x64 pixel square within the image.  The top row of images show a normal ship, the bottom a cloaked ship.  The first image is neutral, then left thruster firing, front thrusters, right thruster, back thruster, all thrusters (braking), and warping.</p>

<h2 id="[world]"><a name="world"></a>[World]</h2>

<p>This section contains options for how large the universe is.  These options should be set to be <em>at least</em> as large as the Screen options, but can be larger.  <em>It is generally recommended that they are each 1.5 or 2 times the value of their corresponding Screen values.</em></p>

<h3 id="collisions-=-boolean">collisions = boolean</h3>

<p>Turn collision detection on/off in the physics engine.  Useful for introductions to the world without worrying about actual interference.  <strong>Note:</strong> Most non-basic games won&#39;t work without this option on.</p>

<h3 id="width-=-integer">width = integer</h3>

<p>Horizontal length of the universe in pixels. <em>Alternately, you can specify &quot;x&quot; and a number to multiply the horizontal resolution value by your number for the world width.</em></p>

<h3 id="height-=-integer">height = integer</h3>

<p>Vertical length of the universe in pixels. <em>Alternately, you can specify &quot;x&quot; and a number to multiply the vertical resolution value by your number for the world height.</em></p>

<h3 id="radar_include_name-=-boolean">radar_include_name = boolean</h3>

<p>Determines if the name of the ship can be obtained through a Radar Command or not.</p>

<h2 id="[server]"><a name="server"></a>[Server]</h2>

<p>This section of options controls how the server should behave and accept connections from clients.</p>

<h3 id="port-=-integer">port = integer</h3>

<p>The TCP/IP port that the server should run on.  If this is changed from the default (<strong>2012</strong>), then a third parameter of a port number must be passed in when running the TextClient class from a Java client.</p>

<h3 id="multiple_connections-=-boolean">multiple_connections = boolean</h3>

<p>This option when enabled allows the same client machine to be connected to the server more than once.  Otherwise, each IP address is only allowed to connect a single time to a server instance.  This can cause issues if a client’s connection unexpectedly terminates.</p>

<h3 id="allow_re-entry-=-boolean">allow_re-entry = boolean</h3>

<p>Can a player join the server again if they had connected previously and disconnected?</p>

<h3 id="disable_commands-=-string">disable_commands = string</h3>

<p>Comma separated list of ship commands to disable on the server.  E.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">disable_commands = WarpCommand,FireTorpedoCommand
</code></pre></div>
<p>A list of commands can be found in the Command chapter. When a command is invoked that has been disabled, it is simply ignored. A message should return to the client, but they will get a new environment and their ship should continue running.  Its state might just not be what was expected.</p>

<h2 id="[asteroid]"><a name="asteroid"></a>[Asteroid]</h2>

<p>Asteroids are flying debris in space.  They start off with a set amount of momentum and will continue flying in space until impacting ships or destroyed by torpedos.</p>

<h3 id="number-=-integer">number = integer</h3>

<p>The number of asteroids to generate in the universe.</p>

<h2 id="[planet]"><a name="planet"></a>[Planet]</h2>

<p>Planets have gravity wells which can pull ships towards them.  They are solid and will cause damage to ships that impact them.</p>

<h3 id="number-=-integer">number = integer</h3>

<p>The number of planets to generate in the universe.</p>

<h3 id="range_min-=-integer">range_min = integer</h3>

<p>see range_max</p>

<h3 id="range_max-=-integer">range_max = integer</h3>

<p>These two range values correspond to the distance away from a planet&#39;s center that its gravity field should pull ships in.  A random value will be generated between the <strong>range_min</strong> and <strong>range_max</strong> values.  These are typically <strong>112</strong> and <strong>192</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="pull_min-=-integer">pull_min = integer</h3>

<p>see pull_max</p>

<h3 id="pull_max-=-integer">pull_max = integer</h3>

<p>These two values correspond to the amount of pull the gravity will have on ships.  Larger values mean ships will get pulled in quicker and will have a harder time escaping.  A random value will be generated between <strong>pull_min</strong> and <strong>pull_max</strong>.  These are typically <strong>8</strong> and <strong>24</strong>.  Setting pull to zero, will turn off gravity.</p>

<h2 id="[blackhole]"><a name="blackhole"></a>[BlackHole]</h2>

<p>Black Holes have stronger gravity wells than planets, but can be passed through their center.  They are harder to escape from.</p>

<p>They have the exact same configuration values as <a href="#planet">Planets</a>.  However, the default range values are <strong>64</strong> and <strong>208</strong>.  The default pull values are <strong>52</strong> and <strong>72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="[nebula]"><a name="nebula"></a>[Nebula]</h2>

<p>Nebulas are a celestial body which impart a drag effect on ships causing them to slow down or eventually stop if they are not thrusting.</p>

<h3 id="number-=-integer">number = integer</h3>

<p>The number of Nebulas to generate in the universe.</p>

<h3 id="sizes-=-list-of-tuples">sizes = list of tuples</h3>

<p>This is a list of the available sizes of nebulas.  The tuple pair is the total length of the <strong>major</strong> and <strong>minor</strong> axes of an ellipse.  There also needs to be a corresponding image in the <em>GUI\Graphics\Nebula</em> folder with the name <strong>NebulaMAJORxMINOR</strong> where &#39;MAJOR&#39; and &#39;MINOR&#39; are replaced with the values of the size of the Nebula.  These values should be placed in a list.  E.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sizes=[(512,128),(384,256)]
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="pull_min-=-integer">pull_min = integer</h3>

<p>see pull_max</p>

<h3 id="pull_max-=-integer">pull_max = integer</h3>

<p>These two values correspond to the amount of pull the drag will have on ships.  Larger values mean ships will slow down faster.  It&#39;d best not to make these values higher than the Ship&#39;s Thruster force of 3500.  A random value will be generated between <strong>pull_min</strong> and <strong>pull_max</strong>.  These are typically <strong>1750</strong> and <strong>2500</strong>.  Setting pull to zero, will turn off drag.</p>

<h2 id="[game]"><a name="game"></a>[Game]</h2>

<p>Main options for the behavior of the simulation and which tournament rules should be applied.</p>

<h3 id="game-=-string">game = string</h3>

<p>Name of the game to be played on the server.  See more info in the Competitions chapter about running games.</p>

<p>To just have a standard universe running, use <strong>BasicGame</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="auto_start-=-boolean">auto_start = boolean</h3>

<p>When set to true the game/round will automatically start when the server is run.  Otherwise, it will wait for you to press the space key.</p>

<p>This value is set to <em>false</em> if tournament is set to <em>true</em>.</p>

<h3 id="allow_after_start-=-boolean">allow_after_start = boolean</h3>

<p>Can players join the server after the game has already started?</p>

<h3 id="disconnect_on_death-=-boolean">disconnect_on_death = boolean</h3>

<p>Determines if a player will be completely disconnected from the server when they die.</p>

<h3 id="reset_score_on_death-=-boolean">reset_score_on_death = boolean</h3>

<p>Will a player&#39;s score reset to 0 when they die.</p>

<h3 id="points_lost_on_death-=-positive-integer">points_lost_on_death = positive integer</h3>

<p>Number of points a player loses when they die. Should be a <strong>positive</strong> integer or zero.</p>

<h3 id="points_initial-=-positive-integer">points_initial = positive integer</h3>

<p>Number of points each player should start with.  Should be a <strong>positive</strong> integer or zero.</p>

<h3 id="primary_victory_attr-=-string">primary_victory_attr = string</h3>

<p>This represents what the primary victory condition should be.  For basic games, this will either be <strong>score</strong> or <strong>bestscore</strong>.  Which either represents their current score or the best score they&#39;ve achieved between deaths.  Other games may have other attributes which can be inspected.</p>

<h3 id="primary_victory_highest-=-boolean">primary_victory_highest = boolean</h3>

<p>Represents if the primary victory condition is sorted from highest to lowest (this is usually the case).</p>

<h3 id="secondary_victory_attr-=-string">secondary_victory_attr = string</h3>

<p>This represents what should break ties on the primary victory condition.  For basic games, this is usually <strong>deaths</strong>, but could also be <strong>bestscore</strong> for instance.</p>

<h3 id="secondary_victory_highest-=-boolean">secondary_victory_highest = boolean</h3>

<p>Represents if the secondary victory condition is sorted from highest to lowest.  For instance, if you wanted least deaths to be the tie-breaker, then you would set the secondary victory condition to be <strong>deaths</strong> and this value to be <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="[tournament]"><a name="tournament"></a>[Tournament]</h2>

<p>Tournaments are run for more advanced games and divide players into groups to compete for a top score.  Then the top player from each round will advance to a final round.  This section defines settings related to running tournaments.  See more info in the Competitions chapter.</p>

<h3 id="tournament-=-boolean">tournament = boolean</h3>

<p>Should the game be run in a tournament setting where connected players are split into a number of groups.  Each winner of the game in a group proceeds to a final bracket to determine a winner.  Each round will automatically be paired, timed, and calculated.  Just hit space to start each round.</p>

<h3 id="tournament_groups-=-integer">tournament_groups = integer</h3>

<p>How many groups should the number of clients connected be broken into for the tournament?  E.g. Setting this value to 5 and having 30 clients connected would result in 5 rounds of 6 players each and a final round with the winners of each group.  Raising this number to higher values requires more vertical real-estate for the tournament display board.</p>

<h3 id="number_to_final_round-=-integer">number_to_final_round = integer</h3>

<p>How many players from each preliminary round should advance to the final round. i.e. The top X players will be taken into the final round where X is this options value.</p>

<h3 id="round_time-=-integer">round_time = integer</h3>

<p>How long each game round should last in seconds.</p>

<h3 id="reset_world_each_round-=-boolean">reset_world_each_round = boolean</h3>

<p>Should the world be cleared of all objects and recreated between each round of play?</p>
